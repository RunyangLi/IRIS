# IRIS
This project takes the recognition of warblios as an example, and builds a neural network, trains a model, and identifies irises by obtaining iris data. 
Iris classification: Iris iris, iris variegated, iris Virginia. 
The main characteristics used to identify warbler flowers: iris calyx length, calyx wide, petal length, petal width. 
Iris Identification
Idea Process: 
1.Obtain iris data, analyze and process;

2.Organize the data bits training set, test set;

3.build a neural network model;

4.Train the network and optimize the network model parameters;

5.Save the optimal model for iris identification.
